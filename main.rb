% is a little weird. In Ruby, it isn't percent, it is modulo. Modulo is like division, but it gives you just the remainder of a division problem.


numberOne = 6
numberTwo = 8
numberThree = 5
numberFour = 12
numberFive = 36

testOne = numberTwo * numberThree #fill in the blank to make this 40
testTwo = numberFive % numberOne #fill in the blank to make this 0
testThree = numberFour - numberThree #fill in the blank to make this 7
if testOne == 40 && testTwo == 0 && testThree == 7
    puts true
